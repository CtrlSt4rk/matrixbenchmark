# Matrix Benchmark
A simple matrix multiplication parallel benchmark using OpenMP with int and float variants that auto-ajusts the thread count used in the tests within your own Linux PC.
Disclaimer: in its current state, the benchmark takes a couple hours in a modern desktop PC. It's more accurate if the PC is dedicated to this operation.
